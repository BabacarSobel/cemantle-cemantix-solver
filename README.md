# Cemantle Cemantix Solver

A C# solution to solve the daily challenges of **Cemantle** and **Cemantix** using automation and algorithms. This project provides a practical approach to solving these semantic-based word puzzles by testing a list of words through the game's API or Selenium. Future plans include incorporating semantic word links and AI for smarter, faster solutions.

## Features

- **Automated Word Testing**:
    - Uses the **API** or **Selenium** to interact with the game's interface and test word lists.
    - Fetches results for each word and evaluates proximity to the solution.

- **Custom Word Lists**:
    - Supports configurable word lists for efficient testing.
    - Optimized to prioritize high-probability words based on game patterns.

## How It Works

1. **Using the API**:
    - Interacts with the game's backend (API) to test words in bulk, retrieving proximity scores.

2. **Using Selenium**:
    - Automates the web browser to test words directly on the Cemantle or Cemantix web interface.

3. **Next Steps**:
    - Implementing **semantic word linking** to analyze relationships between words for smarter guesses.
    - Leveraging **AI and machine learning** for predictive solutions.

## Future Plans

- **Semantic Word Links**:
    - Build relationships between words based on their semantic connections to improve guess accuracy.

- **AI Integration**:
    - Incorporate machine learning models to predict likely solutions.
    - Use language models (e.g., GPT) for enhanced word suggestions.

- **Enhanced Automation**:
    - Support multiple puzzle-solving strategies for both Cemantle and Cemantix.
    - Add a GUI for a more user-friendly experience.
